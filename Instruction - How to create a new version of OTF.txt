INSTRUCTION - HOW TO CREATE A NEW OTF VERSION

1. Making a new version
The folder 1_XSD_BluePrint contains separate XSD files for each re-used element.
After modifying elements, an autogenerator can be used to first debug each file separately and then convert it into a single C# file.

2. Preparing the new version for use
The folder 2_Solution contains a C# solution.
Each new version should be added as a separate project so that a .DLL file is built. 
The samplefile generator must be used to generate sample files for each version. It exports both XML and JSON

3. Preparing the new version for release
Use 3_XSD_Builder to generate a new, singular XSD based on the .DLL file that you built in the earlier step.
Create a new folder in 9_Release for this new version and gather the XSD, DLL and sample files there.
A Message Implementation Guide (MIG) should be added in PDF format.

4. Releasing the new version
The whole project should be uploaded to the public repository.
