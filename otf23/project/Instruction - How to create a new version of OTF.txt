INSTRUCTION - HOW TO CREATE A NEW OTF VERSION

1. Making a new version
Duplicate the version subfolder in the XSD_BLUEPRINT that contains separate XSD files for each re-used element.
After copying folder, re-versioning and modifying elements, and autogenerator can be used to first debug each file separately and then convert it into a single C# file.

2. Preparing the new version for use
The folder SOLUTION contains a C# solution.
Each new version should be added as a separate project so that a .DLL file is built. (the project must be a C# Class Library .NET Framework project, otherwise later xsd.exe generation won't work!)
The samplefile generator must be used to generate sample files for each version. It exports both XML and JSON

3. Preparing the new version for release
Use GENERATOR to generate a new, singular XSD based on the .DLL file that you built in the earlier step.
Create a new folder in Release for this new version and gather the XSD, DLL and sample files there.
A Message Implementation Guide (MIG) should be added in PDF format.

4. Releasing the new version
The whole project should be uploaded to the public repository.
